# Overview

{Important! Do not say in this section that this is college assignment. Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

I took plenty of examples from the Tutorial and used them in IntelliJ to display classes, methods, interfaces, etc.

I wrote this software to demonstrate what I've learned about coding in the Kotlin language.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough
of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

I used VS Code and IntelliJ IDE CE and I used Kotlin to create the software.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- Be a bit more focused on writing newer code instead using code from the readings.
- Start work on code early on in case of computer troubles (in my case, it was my MacBook's keyboard losing a key and 
having to buy an external keyboard to finish)
